### Adds in bees as an alternate way to gather raw resources.

Start with honey production. Make queens that give birth to larva. Larva can grow into different bee castes, the worker and the queen. Once you have a steady stream of resources for your colony, experiment with genetic mutation in order to collect different species of bees. Use the extra larva from the above loop to create honey and royal jelly, which can then be used to create queens for different ore types. These queens give birth to more larva which can be turned into ores

The mod is designed to be fully dynamic, and will react to any ores in your mod list

### Other features
- A logistic beehive that has no charging ports and a tiny logistic area, but has a small footprint and is suited for logistic bees. Logistic bees have low stack sizes, and slowish speed, but don't require power. (Can be disabled in mod options)
- Propolis ammo, which is really just a way to void extra mutated propolis gained from genetic mutation
- You can get oil from coal bees + coal liquefaction
