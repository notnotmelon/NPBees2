[entity-description]
liquiformer-1=Liquefies combs before casting them into molds and honey
liquiformer-2=Allows liquiforming to happen faster by turning solids into foams instead of liquids
sequencer=Uses raw materials and mutated propolis to create custom DNA.
genetic-transposer=Transposes DNA into bees to change their species. Requires lots of energy
hive-1=A basic hive for honey production
hive-2=An advanced hive used to create raw materials
hive-3=An climate-controlled hive with optimizations to increase bee speed
apiary=Incubates larva until they reach adulthood
logistic-hive=An isolated interface with the logistic network, perfect for congested areas. Does not have charging ports, and is suited for bees
nursery=A place for queens to produce larva.

bee-logistic=A genetically modified bee suited for transporting objects quickly
